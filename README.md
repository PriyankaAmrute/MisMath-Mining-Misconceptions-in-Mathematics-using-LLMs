ðŸ“˜ Mismath: Mining Misconceptions in Mathematics using LLMs

Mismath is a research-driven project that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and analyze common misconceptions in mathematics. The goal is to support educators by uncovering patterns in student errors and linking them to underlying misconceptions, which can then be used to design better assessments, personalized feedback, and targeted learning interventions.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features

Misconception Mining: Automatically extracts and categorizes misconceptions from student responses.

LLM-powered Insights: Utilizes transformer-based models to understand the semantic relationship between incorrect answers (distractors) and misconceptions.

Data-driven Feedback: Provides interpretable mappings that help teachers align distractors with potential misconceptions.

Research-Oriented: Focused on bridging the gap between NLP/ML techniques and educational psychology for improving mathematics learning.

ðŸŽ¯ Applications

Assisting educators in designing MCQs with meaningful distractors.

Enhancing adaptive learning systems by integrating misconception-aware models.

Providing actionable insights for curriculum development and student support.
